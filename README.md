# My Tools 

Welcome to "My Tools," a repository showcasing my personal projects and tools developed for pentesting, network analysis, and programming exploration.

## Overview
This collection includes tools I’ve built. Each tool is hosted on its own GitHub repository, linked below with brief descriptions.

## Tools

### So1icitx ARP Spoofer
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/so1icitx/so1icitx-arp-spoofer](https://github.com/so1icitx/so1icitx-arp-spoofer)  
- **Purpose**: A tool for performing ARP spoofing attacks to enable man-in-the-middle (MITM) capabilities. Useful for intercepting network traffic on local networks.  
- **Features**: Spoofs ARP tables to redirect traffic through the attacker's machine.  
- **Use Case**: Network security testing and educational purposes.

### So1 Hash Identifier
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/so1icitx/so1-hash-identifier](https://github.com/so1icitx/so1-hash-identifier)  
- **Purpose**: Identifies the type of hash (e.g., MD5, SHA1) based on its format or characteristics.  
- **Features**: Analyzes hash strings and suggests possible algorithms.  
- **Use Case**: Precursor to hash cracking during CTFs or pentests.

### So1ic Network Scanner
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/so1icitx/so1ic-network-scanner](https://github.com/so1icitx/so1ic-network-scanner)  
- **Purpose**: Scans networks to discover live hosts, open ports, and services.  
- **Features**: Likely includes basic port scanning and host discovery functionalities.  
- **Use Case**: Reconnaissance phase of pentesting engagements.

### MacSo1i
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/so1icitx/macso1i](https://github.com/so1icitx/macso1i)  
- **Purpose**: A MAC address spoofer to change the network interface’s MAC address.  
- **Features**: Allows temporary MAC address modification for anonymity or bypassing MAC-based filters.  
- **Use Case**: Evading network restrictions or testing MAC filtering security.

## Learning Journey

### So1icitx Programming Journey
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/so1icitx/so1icitx-programming-journey](https://github.com/so1icitx/so1icitx-programming-journey)  
- **Purpose**: A personal log of my programming learning process, including projects, exercises, and notes.  
- **Features**: Documents my growth in coding skills, likely with examples in various languages.  
- **Use Case**: Inspiration for others and a reference for my own progress.
